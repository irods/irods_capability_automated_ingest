## [0.6.0] - 2024-10-14

## [v0.5.0] - 2024-07-17

This release adds more functionality when scanning an S3 bucket
and updates the testing harness and a number of dependencies.

Note: The signatures for all pre/post event handler methods
(e.g. `pre_data_obj_create`) have been changed to include an
`*args` parameter.  Any existing event handler files will need
to be updated by inserting the new parameter just before the
`**options` keyword argument:

```diff
     @staticmethod
-    def pre_data_obj_create(hdlr_mod, logger, session, meta, **options):
+    def pre_data_obj_create(hdlr_mod, logger, session, meta, *args, **options):
```
